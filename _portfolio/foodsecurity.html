<b>Description:</b>
<br>
This project aimed to enhance public awareness and supervision of food security using advanced technology. We built a graph database with Neo4j, designed a visual web page for presenting food-related risks, and implemented interactive visualizations including a knowledge graph and dynamic maps. Additionally, a 3D hot search word cloud and keyword fuzzy search function were integrated for a more immersive and efficient user experience.<br>
<br>
<b>In this project, I was responsible for:</b><br>
1. Designed and used Neo4j to build a graph database with 654 entities and 188 entity relationships, and then deployed to the server.<br>
2. Designed an innovative visual web page about food security, providing a platform for presenting food-related risks and facilitating the publicâ€™s supervision, and established the web front-end by designing and applying VUE+Element. <br>
3. Visualized an interactive knowledge graph with high information density using VIS.JS base.<br>
4. Utilized E-Chart to build visualization modules of the dynamic maps to present food security information.<br>
5. Implemented interactive spherical dynamic 3D hot search word clouds as well as achieved a key-word fuzzy search function under VUE framework.<br>
