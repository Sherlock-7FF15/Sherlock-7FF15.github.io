In light of the recent explosion in Internet of Things (IoT) device adoption, security vulnerabilities, particularly those associated with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, have become more acute. Our earlier work focused on an LSTM-driven model capable of identifying advanced DDoS threats, but was largely validated on synthetic datasets. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a test environment using Raspberry Pi units that replicate the intricacies of a comprehensive IoT network. This infrastructure enables us to generate authentic DDoS attack scenarios involving IoT devices and assess the efficacy of various DDoS mitigation strategies.<br>
