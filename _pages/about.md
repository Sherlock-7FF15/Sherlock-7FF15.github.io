Research experience
------
### Autonomous Networks Research Group, USC
**May 2023 - present**  
_Instructor: Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari_  
_Direct Research_  
* Developed a Raspberry Pi based IoT DDoS simulation framework with a time-step driven architecture, using a control server to manage node behaviors and simulate botnet states through UDP packets based on a real IoT dataset.
* Applied a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) model for deep learning analysis of network data, and implemented an inference framework on Raspberry Pi with TensorFlow for real-time DDoS attack detection.  
### AI Lab, Hubei University
**March 2019 - December 2021**  
_Instructor: Prof. Prof. Lan You_  
_Research Assistent_  
* Designed a food security platform with a Neo4j graph database, interactive knowledge graph visualization, and dynamic maps.
* Developed a spatial-temporal recommendation system for taxi waiting times using an optimized MLP neural network.
* Contributed to a real-time vessel trajectory prediction system using AIS data and an optimized Seq2Seq model.
* Built a binary-class image recognition ensemble model using mainstream neural networks
