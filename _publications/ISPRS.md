**Abstract:** Taxi waiting times is an important criterion for taxi passengers to choose appropriate pick-up locations in urban environments. How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxisâ€™ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times. This work provides a decision support for intelligent travel predictions of taxi waiting time in a smart city.
