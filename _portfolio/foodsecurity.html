This project aimed to enhance public awareness and supervision of food security using advanced technology. We built a graph database with Neo4j, designed a visual web page for presenting food-related risks, and implemented interactive visualizations including a knowledge graph and dynamic maps. Additionally, a 3D hot search word cloud and keyword fuzzy search function were integrated for a more immersive and efficient user experience.
